## Your Task

Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. You’ll need to submit a link to the video **and** add it to the README of your project.

### User Story

```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```


## Acknowledgements

I collaberated with other students Connor Lee and Samuel Pedroza to complete this challenge. Our work will look very similar.

The test files were already provided by our instructor, Rachel. She gave permission to use the provided test files to complete the challenge.

Some of the SVG files created while testing this application have been saved to the 'examples' folder for reference.
